## Hand evaluation
We are using the traditional HCP system, where A = 4; K = 3; Q = 2 and J = 1. 

For NT contracts, hand shapes are less important whereas whether a suit is stopped is far more important. 
Examples of stoppers: Kx, Qxx, J10xx. When opponents have intefered the auction by showing various suits, 
it is important to have stopper in those suits before bidding 3NT. I included 5M332 hands and 6m322 hands in NT openings as balance because opening NT in 
those cases reflects your hand better to your partner, and there is rarely harm if you are playing in IMPs.

For suited contracts, shapey hands should be more frequently upgraded and balance hand should be downgraded.
For example, player can add 3 distributional points to his/her hand for a void, 1.5 for a singleton. However, distributional points should not be lightly 
added to your hand in order to open 1C, as HCP is a better evaluation tool to determine whether the partnership has a game. Especially when the partnership
has misfit hands, if the stronger hand opened 1C with less than 16 HCP and partner GF with less than 8, 3NT is unlikely to make. 

Edge cases: I recommend a hand with 4♠️4♥️5♦️ and void club with 14 HCP to open 1♦️ (and not 1♣️ based on distribution). Firstly, you convey a better range of strength of your hand to your partner and on a
misfit hand, partner will not go 3NT with less than 24 HCP in total. Secondly, 1♦️ has a better structure for finding 4-4 major fit.
