## General bidding style
1♦️ is not always forcing, with 0-6 HCP, no 4M and at least 4~5♦️, 1♦️ is passable. 
For opener rebid, min refers to 11 - bad 13, while max refers to good 13 - 15.
Do note that any max hand shld be unbalanced.

1M : 4M, does not necessarily deny 4oM, F1
1NT : 7-11 NF, usually to play, can be 0-6 with clubs also
2C : 11+, can be long♣️ or mm, F1
2D : ! 11+, can be long♦️ or mm, F1
2H : RFlan, showing 5♠️4♥️ exactly, less than INV, NF
2S : RFLan, showing 5♠️4♥️ exactly, INV+ 
2NT : INV, NF

## Responses to 1♦️ - 1M
When auction goes into this sequence, bidding becomes much natural and easy. There are various gadgets such as 
[XYNT](https://www.bridgebum.com/two_way_checkback.php), XYZ(Same as XYNT except the third bid is 1oM) and 
[Fourth suit forcing](https://www.bridgebum.com/fourth_suit_forcing.php)
to determine whether there is a fit and establish invite or game force. Here is the general idea:
```
1NT : Min, BAL, no 4SPPT, cannot be short in partner suit
2♣️ : both minors(8+ in total)
2♦️ : 6+♦️
2oM : Max, 5+♦️, 4oM
2M : Min, 4SPPT
3X : Max, 5+♦️ and 5+X
3M : Max, 4SPPT
```
