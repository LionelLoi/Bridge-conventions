## General bidding style
1♦️ is not always forcing, with 0-6 HCP, no 4M and at least 4~5♦️, 1♦️ is passable. 
For opener rebid, min refers to 11 - bad 13, while max refers to good 13 - 15.
Do note that any max hand shld be unbalanced.

## Responses to 1♦️ - 1M
When auction goes into this sequence, bidding becomes much natural and easy. There are various gadgets such as 
[XYNT](https://www.bridgebum.com/two_way_checkback.php), XYZ(Same as XYNT except the third bid is 1oM) and 
[Fourth suit forcing](https://www.bridgebum.com/fourth_suit_forcing.php) (for 1♦️ - 1M - 2m)
to determine whether there is a fit and establish invite or game force. Here is the general idea:

1NT : Min, BAL, no 4SPPT, cannot be short in partner suit

2♣️ : both minors(8+ in total)

2♦️ : 6+♦️

2oM : Max, 5+♦️, 4oM

2M : Min, 4SPPT

3X : Max, 5+♦️ and 5+X

3M : Max, 4SPPT

## 1♦️ - 1NT 
Many players are happy to see this sequence on the table, because this means that the auction is almost over, especially if opener was 11-13 balanced. 
However, if opener was 13-15 with minors or long diamond, opener need to bid on and search for a better part score or even minor game.

## 1♦ - 2♣️
This is the most artificial part in 1♦️ opening, even though it is rarely used, it is still a must-have to find minor game or slams.

2♦️ : 5+♦️, deny 4SPPT, unbalanced
> 2M : 4M, GF

> 3m : NF, preferred m

> else : Nat, GF
    
2♥️ : ! Min, BAL
    
2S : ! Ambiguous SPL, 4+ SPPT, GF (Not short diamonds)

> 2NT : ask for SPL (opener shows ♣️/♦️ as ♥️/♠️), afterwards start cuebidding
    
2NT/3NT : 4441 Min/Max 

3♣️ : ! 3SPPT, 5+om, one 4M, GF

> 3♦️ : ask for 4M
    
3♦️ : long♦️, GF

3M : 6+♦️5M, GF
